A few weeks ago, a teammate of mine asked me to make some icons he could use for a simple star style "ratings" system.

I gave them to him as .svg, since I figured he would want the advantages of a vector format. Specifically, the ability to style them with CSS, as he was just setting this up and hadn't made any decisions yet about page design.

Turns out, he was unaware of the advantages of .svg formatted images, so I made [this presentation](../../svg-is-awesome) to show off some of the more fun aspects of the format.
The presentation was made using [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/), a super quick presentation framework.
